`The emergence of textile, apparel, and retail enterprises in the United States is full of fascinating twists. In 1790, for instance, an act of industrial espionage is said to have launched the domestic textile industry, if not American manufacturing in general. At that time, Samuel Slater, a skilled mechanic, built the first successful water-powered yarn spinning mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Yarn was in short supply in the new country and much in demand in households that did hand weaving as well as in workplaces with looms that produced sheeting, shirting, and stockings for commerce. Some of the American states and improvement societies had even offered generous rewards for the establishment of water-powered combing and spinning, especially those based on state-of-the-art English Arkwright operations. But British law strictly prohibited the export of drawings, plans, or models of these new technologies. It took somebody like Slater—an indentured apprentice for over six years at the Arkwright and Strut’s plant in Milford, England—to ferry the plans to America.1`
